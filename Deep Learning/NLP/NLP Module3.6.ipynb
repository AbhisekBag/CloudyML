Talking about RNN, it is a network that works on the present input by taking into consideration the previous output and storing in its memory for a short period of time. Out of its various applications, the most popular ones are in the fields of speech processing, non-Markovian control, and music composition. \n","###Drawbacks to RNNs. \n","First, it fails to store information for a longer period of time. At times, a reference to certain information stored quite a long time ago is required to predict the current output. But RNNs are absolutely incapable of handling such “long-term dependencies”.\n","Second, there is no finer control over which part of the context needs to be carried forward and how much of the past needs to be ‘forgotten’.\n","Other issues with RNNs are exploding and vanishing gradients which occur during the training process of a network through backtracking. \n","<br>\n","<br>\n","\n","Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)was brought into the picture. It has been so designed that the vanishing gradient problem is almost completely removed, while the training model is left unaltered. Long time lags in certain problems are bridged using LSTMs where they also handle noise, distributed representations, and continuous values. With LSTMs, there is no need to keep a finite number of states from beforehand as required in the hidden Markov model. LSTMs provide us with a large range of parameters such as learning rates, and input and output biases. Hence, no need for fine adjustments. The complexity to update each weight is reduced to O(1) with LSTMs, similar to that of Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT), which is an advantage. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vI4qJ4Pyj3lI"},"source":["####Exploding and Vanishing Gradients problems: \n","\n","During the training process of a network, the main goal is to minimize loss observed in the output when training data is sent through it. We calculate the gradient, that is, loss with respect to a particular set of weights, adjust the weights accordingly and repeat this process until we get an optimal set of weights for which loss is minimum. This is the concept of backtracking. \n","<br>\n","Sometimes, it so happens that the gradient is almost negligible. It must be noted that the gradient of a layer depends on certain components in the successive layers. If some of these components are small (less than 1), the result obtained, which is the gradient, will be even smaller. This is known as the scaling effect. <br>\n","When this gradient is multiplied with the learning rate which is in itself a small value ranging between 0.1-0.001, it results in a smaller value. As a consequence, the alteration in weights is quite small, producing almost the same output as before. <br>\n","Similarly, if the gradients are quite large in value due to the large values of components, the weights get updated to a value beyond the optimal value. This is known as the problem of exploding gradients. To avoid this scaling effect, the neural network unit was re-built in such a way that the scaling factor was fixed to one. The cell was then enriched by several gating units and was called LSTM.
